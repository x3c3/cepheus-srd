# Chapter 3: Common Grav Vehicles

This section describes some of the grav vehicles that can be commonly encountered in Cepheus Engine campaigns. These are not the only types of grav vehicles that exist, and creative Referees are encouraged to integrate grav vehicles of their own creation or from other sources into their universes as they see fit.

## TL9 Air/Raft

Using an open four-ton chassis (0 Hull, 1 Structure, Armor 3), the Air/Raft is a classic example of a basic vehicle propelled by anti-gravity technology. It carries an Early Fusion power plant, Code E, and a Grav propulsion system, Code E, giving a top speed of 100 kph, a cruising speed of 75 kph, and an Agility DM of +0. 1.61 liters of hydrogen support the power plant for 28 days. This vehicle is equipped with Advanced controls, a Class III communication system (Regional), basic civilian sensors (DM -2), and a Model 1 computer. It also comes equipped with Autopilot (Grav Vehicle-0). There is a basic cockpit and three cramped seats. Cargo capacity is 24.57 kiloliters, or just over two displacement tons. The vehicle requires a crew of one, the pilot. The vehicle can carry three additional passengers in cramped seats. The vehicle costs KCr94.340 (including discounts and fees) and takes 36 hours to build.
