The vehicle has 160 weapon points, but only 23 are used. The vehicle has four small turrets armed with Autocannon-TL 8, one small turret armed with a Heavy Mass Driver-TL 8, eight small turrets armed with Heavy Rocket Artillery-TL 7, four missile racks (armed with Smart Standard HE missiles), and two HE torpedo ordinance bays (3 torpedoes each). This vehicle also carries 1800 rounds of Autocannon ammunition, 300 rounds of Heavy Mass Driver ammunition, 900 rounds of Heavy Rocket Artillery ammunition, 900 Smart Standard HE missiles, and 240 Standard HE torpedoes. Cargo capacity is 70.615 tons. The chassis is additionally armored with Titanium Steel (×2.) The vehicle requires a crew of 28: 1 Captain, 1 Executive Officer, 3 Pilots, 1 Navigator, 1 Engineer, 1 Sensors Operator, 17 Turret Gunners, 2 Bay Weapon Gunners, and 1 Chief Security Officer.
